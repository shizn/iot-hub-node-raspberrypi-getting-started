# Troubleshooting
## Hardware issues
### The application runs well but the LED is not blinking
This issue is always related to the hardware circuit connectivity. Use the following steps to identify problems.

1. Check that you chose the correct **GPIO** on your board. The two ports should be **GPIO GND (Pin 6)** and **GPIO 04 (Pin 7)**.
2. Check that the polarity of your LED is correct. The longer leg should indicate the **positive**, anode pin.
3. Use the **3.3V Pin** and **GND Pin** on Raspberry Pi 3. Treat Pi as the DC power. Check that the LED works fine.

### Other hardware issues
For information about solving common problems on Raspberry Pi 3, see the [official troubleshooting page](http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting).

## Node.js package issues
### No response during gulp tasks
If you encounter problems running gulp tasks, you can add the `--verbose` option for debugging. Try to terminate current gulp tasks by using `Ctrl + C`, and then run the following command in your console window to see debug messages. You might see detailed error messages in your console output. 

```bash
gulp --verbose
```

### Device discovery issues
For help in troubleshooting common problems with the `devdisco` command, check the [readme](https://github.com/Azure/device-discovery-cli/blob/develop/readme.md).

### NPM issues
Try to update your NPM package with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g npm
```

If the problem still exists, leave your comments at the end of this article or create a GitHub issue in our [sample repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-getting-started)

## Remote debugging

Remote debugging support will be available soon in Visual Studio Code C/C++ Extension.

In a meanwhile you can use GDB via your favourite SSH terminal:

```bash
cd c-pi-lesson-x
sudo gdb app
```

## Azure-CLI issues
The Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) is a preview build. Look for solution in the [Preview Install Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/master/doc/preview_install_guide.md) to seek solutions. Try to upgrade Azure-cli to latest version when commands donâ€™t work as expected.

If you encounter any bugs with the tool, file an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues) in the **Issues** section of the GitHub repo.

For help troubleshooting common problems, check the [readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/master/README.rst).

If you meet "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement", please run the following command to upgrade pip to lastest version.

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Python installation issues
### Legacy installation issues (macOS)
When you're installing **pip**, a permission error is thrown when older packages that are installed with **su** permissions. This situation occurs because a previous installation of Python using brew (macOS) is not uninstalled completely. Some **pip** packages from a previous installation were created by root, which causes the permission error. The solution is to remove those packages installed by root. Use the following steps to complete this task:

1. Go to: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
2. List packages create by root: `ls -l | grep root`
3. Uninstall packages from step 2: `sudo rm -rf {package name}`
4. Reinstall Python.

## Azure IoT Hub issues
If you've successfully provisioned your Azure IoT hub with `azure-cli`, and you need a tool to manage the devices that are connecting to your IoT hub, try the following tools:

### Device Explorer
[Device Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer) runs on your Windows local machine and connects to your IoT hub in Azure. It communicates with the following [IoT Hub endpoints](iot-hub-devguide.md):

* *Device identity management* to provision and manage devices registered with your IoT hub.
* *Receive device-to-cloud* so you can monitor messages sent from your device to your IoT hub.
* *Send cloud-to-device* so you can send messages to your devices from your IoT hub.

Configure your `IoT hub connection string` within this tool to use all its capabilities.

### IoT hub Explorer
[IoT hub Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/iothub-explorer) is a sample multiplatform CLI tool to manage device clients. You can use the tool to manage the devices in the identity registry, monitor device-to-cloud messages, and send cloud-to-device commands.

To install the latest (prerelease) version of the iothub-explorer tool, run the following command in your command-line environment:

```
npm install -g iothub-explorer@latest
```

You can use the following command to get additional help about all the iothub-explorer commands and their parameters:

```bash
iothub-explorer help
```

### Azure portal
A full CLI experience helps you create and manage all your Azure resources. You might also want to use the [Azure portal](../azure-portal-overview.md) to help provision, manage, and debug your Azure resources.

## Azure storage issues
[Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer (preview)](http://storageexplorer.com) is a standalone app from Microsoft that you can use to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux. By using this tool, you can connect to your table and see the data in it. You can use this tool to troubleshoot your Azure Storage issues.
